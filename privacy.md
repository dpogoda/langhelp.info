# Privacy Policy

## Introduction
We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting any data that we may collect from you. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our website and services.

## Data We Collect
We collect minimal data to provide and improve our services. This includes:

- **IP Address**: When you connect to our server, your IP address is temporarily stored for rate-limiting purposes (using npm express-rate-limiter). This helps protect our services from abuse and excessive use.
  
- **Session ID**: When you perform certain tasks on our site, a temporary session ID is generated and stored for the duration of the session. This session ID is used to fetch the results of AI tasks. Once the session expires, the session ID is no longer stored.

We do not collect or store any other personal information unless explicitly provided by you.

## Cookies and Tracking Technologies
We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to enhance your experience on our website and support services such as Google AdSense and Google Analytics. These services help us understand how our website is used and provide relevant advertisements.

- **Google AdSense**: Google AdSense may use cookies to provide targeted ads. You can opt out of personalized ads by adjusting the settings on the cookie consent bar.
  
- **Google Analytics**: We use Google Analytics to track website traffic and usage statistics. This data is anonymized and helps us improve the user experience.

## Managing Cookies and Consent
You have control over the use of cookies on our website. Upon visiting, a cookie consent bar allows you to enable or disable tracking services like Google Analytics and Google AdSense. You can manage your preferences at any time by revisiting the consent bar on our site.

## Data Retention
We retain the IP addresses and session IDs only for the duration necessary to fulfill their intended purpose (e.g., rate-limiting and AI task management). Once they are no longer required, they are promptly deleted.

## Data Security
We are committed to ensuring that your data is secure. We have implemented suitable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect.

## Third-Party Services
Our website may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the content and practices of these sites and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their privacy policies.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices. You will be notified of any significant updates via a notice on our website.
